# Medical Abbreviation Decoder

just a 'decoder' made in lua based off of [NHS abbreviations commonly found in medical records](https://www.nhs.uk/nhs-app/nhs-app-help-and-support/health-records-in-the-nhs-app/abbreviations-commonly-found-in-medical-records/) literally so i could understand doctor notes (including my own)

### Usage

with a lua interpreter (>= 5.1), simply run `lua main.lua` inside the `/src` directory and it will prompt you to enter text which it will attempt to decode if it has any medical abbreviations in
